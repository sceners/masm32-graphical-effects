Fireworks Simulation Program - MMX enriched
===========================================

How to Install: Create a new folder somewhere in your filesystem and extract all files into it to run the program.

How to Uninstall: Delete the same folder :)

You may remove all files except the executable (Firework3.exe) if you are not intended to refer with the program's source code. Sometimes it looks scary to me also.

I'm not including a silly EULA statement. But i remind you that this program is just a simple free eyecandyware. No legal movements against me please. :)

Use it at your own risk. I am not responsible for any kind of problems related to this software. Even if your computer explode.

If you like this program please sign my guestbook.

If you really like this program or found any part of the code useful please consider helping me by donating money, an amount of $2 or more is favourable. Helping me thus will sure push me for updates and more such creations in the future.
